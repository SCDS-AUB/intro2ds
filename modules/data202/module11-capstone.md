# DATA 202 Module 11: Capstone Project

## Introduction

The capstone project is the culmination of DATA 202, where you integrate everything learned throughout both courses into a substantial, original data science project. Unlike the DATA 201 project, this capstone challenges you to work with advanced data types, modern AI tools, and production-quality engineering practices.

---

## Part 1: Capstone Expectations

### What Distinguishes a Capstone

A capstone project should demonstrate:

**Technical Depth**: Use of advanced techniques from DATA 202
- Non-traditional data types (audio, video, documents, graphs)
- Modern ML approaches (transformers, foundation models)
- Production-quality implementation

**Originality**: Not a tutorial reproduction
- Novel question or application
- Creative problem framing
- Contribution beyond coursework

**Completeness**: Full lifecycle coverage
- Data acquisition (APIs, scraping, collection)
- Rigorous analysis and modeling
- Deployment or deployment-ready system
- Documentation and reproducibility

**Reflection**: Critical analysis
- What worked and what didn't
- Limitations and future directions
- Ethical considerations

### Scope Guidelines

**Too Small**:
- Replicating a tutorial with different data
- Simple classification on a clean dataset
- API wrapper without substantial analysis

**Too Large**:
- Multi-year research project
- Production system for a company
- Something requiring resources beyond your access

**Just Right**:
- Novel application of course techniques
- Integration of multiple data types or methods
- Working prototype demonstrating capability

**Requirements**:
- Integration of techniques from multiple modules
- Meaningful combination (not just sequential)
- Demonstration of cross-modal insights

### Category C: Deployed Applications

Build a working application that serves predictions:

**Examples**:

- API or user interface
- Documentation for use and maintenance
- Monitoring or evaluation plan

### Category D: Research Replication and Extension

Replicate and extend a published paper:

**Examples**:
- Replicate a fairness analysis on local data
- Apply a new technique to a classic dataset
- Evaluate claims from a paper with different methods
- Combine approaches from multiple papers

**Requirements**:
- Complete replication (or documented failure)
- Substantive extension
- Critical analysis of original claims

## Final Thoughts

The capstone is your opportunity to synthesize everything you've learned and create something meaningful. The best projects come from genuine curiosity—questions you actually want to answer, problems you want to solve, tools you want to build.

Start early. Iterate often. Ask for help when stuck. And remember: the goal is learning, not perfection. A project that encountered challenges and documented them honestly is more valuable than one that hid difficulties behind polished output.

Welcome to the final challenge of DATA 202. Make it count.
